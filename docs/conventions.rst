Conventions
===========


Examples
--------

When we provide examples in an article we need to use the format below.  Put the reference on its own line and then use a table that shows these four components:

* the source text (Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic)
* the SBL style transliteration
* the literal/interlinear translation
* the smooth translation

See the following example:

Scripture Reference

+----------------------+
|Hebrew/Greek/Aramaic  |
+----------------------+
|transliteration       |
+----------------------+
|literal translation   |
+----------------------+
|smooth translation    |
+----------------------+

See the `Open Siddur transliteration page <http://opensiddur.org/tools/transliterate/>`_ for help with Hebrew transliterations.

Spelling
--------

* Shewa/sheva/shwa/shva should be spelled "shewa"
* Use the full name of various terms instead of abbreviations (e.g. write "infinitive construct" rather than "inf. cs.")


Structural
----------

* Do not duplicate the glossary entry in the article entry
* For the UHG and UAG, paradigms/charts should go in a folder named after what the chart displays.  For example, a chart of the demonstrative pronouns could go in `content/chart_demonstrative_pronouns/01.md`. For the UGG, at least initially, paradigms/charts will be placed in the content/paradigms folder with the name of the paradigm/chart that is displayed.

Typographical
-------------

* Wherever possible, use the actual Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek letters (whether vowels or consonants).  If needed, you may put the name of the letter in parenthesis afterward.
* Wherever possible, include vowels in Hebrew examples that are shown.  Use the 3ms form of verbs to refer to the root or head entry of the verb.


Encoding
--------

* If you are using the web editor then you don't have to worry about font encoding, the editor will automatically make it unicode.
* If you are writing locally then you **must ensure that you are using unicode**.
* The font doesn't matter at this point as display will be taken care of in the rendered output formats (PDF, translationCore, etc.).

Book Abbreviations
------------------

* Since we are writing especially for translators, we'll use the [USFM book codes](http://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/identification/books.html) for references.
