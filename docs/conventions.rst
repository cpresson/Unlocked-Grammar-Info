Conventions
===========


Examples
--------

When we provide examples in an article we need to format them as a table below the reference containing the source text, the transliteration, the interlinear and the translation.  See the following example:

GEN 47:18

+----------------------+
|בשנה השנית            |
+----------------------+
|transliteration       |
+----------------------+
|in the year the second|
+----------------------+
|in the second year    |
+----------------------+


Spelling
--------

* Shewa/sheva/shwa/shva should be spelled "shewa"
* Use the full name of various terms instead of abbreviations (e.g. write "infinitive construct" rather than "inf. cs.")


Structural
----------

* No need to duplicate the glossary entry in the article entry
* For the UHG and UAG, paradigms/charts should go in a folder named after what the chart displays.  For example, a chart of the demonstrative pronouns could go in `content/chart_demonstrative_pronouns/01.md`. For the UGG, at least initially, paradigms/charts will be placed in the content/paradigms folder with the name of the paradigm/chart that is displayed.

Typographical
-------------

* Wherever possible, use the actual Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek letters (whether vowels or consonants).  If needed, you may put the name of the letter in parenthesis afterward.
* Wherever possible, include vowels in Hebrew examples that are shown.  Use the 3ms form of verbs to refer to the root or head entry of the verb.


Encoding
--------

* If you are using the web editor then you don't have to worry about font encoding, the editor will automatically make it unicode.
* If you are writing locally then you **must ensure that you are using unicode**.
* The font doesn't matter at this point as display will be taken care of in the rendered output formats (PDF, translationCore, etc.).

Book Abbreviations
------------------

* Since we are writing especially for translators, we'll use the [USFM book codes](http://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/identification/books.html) for references.
