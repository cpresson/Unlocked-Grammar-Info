Conventions
===========

Markdown Notes
--------------
* :ref:`markdown.html`

Examples
--------

When we provide examples in an article we need to format them as an unordered list, with an indented list below the reference containing the source text and the translation.  See the following example:

* GEN 47:18

  * בשנה השנית
  * in the second year (literally, in the year the second)

Spelling
--------

* Shewa/sheva/shwa/shva should be spelled "shewa"
* Use the full name of various terms instead of abbreviations (e.g. write "infinitive construct" rather than "inf. cs.")


Structural
----------

* No need to duplicate the glossary entry in the article entry
* Paradigms/charts should go in a folder named after what the chart displays.  For example, a chart of the demonstrative pronouns could go in `content/chart_demonstrative_pronouns/01.md`.

Typographical
-------------

* Wherever possible, use the actual Hebrew letters (whether vowels or consonants).  If needed, you may put the name of the letter in parenthesis afterward.
* Wherever possible, include vowels in Hebrew examples that are shown.  Use the 3ms form of verbs to refer to the root or head entry of the verb.


Encoding
--------

* If you are using the web editor then you don't have to worry about font encoding, the editor will automatically make it unicode.
* If you are writing locally then you **must ensure that you are using unicode**.
* The font doesn't matter at this point as display will be taken care of in the rendered output formats (PDF, translationCore, etc.).

Book Abbreviations
------------------

* Since we are writing especially for translators, we'll use the [USFM book codes](http://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/identification/books.html) for references.
