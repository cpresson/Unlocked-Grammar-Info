Writing for English Language Learners (ELL) and Translation
===========================================

Grammatical Tips
----------------
1. Do not use slashes
2. Avoid complex sentence structure; use short sentences
3. Keep subject, verb, and object close together
4. Place main idea before exceptions and conditions
5. Put general statements before specific statements
6. Have only topic per paragraph
7. Avoid the passive voice
8. Relativizing can create issues for translators
9. Some languages do not use non-restrictive relative clauses (RC). Readers may mistake them for restrictive RCs
10. Some languages do not relativize the indirect object or the possessor. Inexperienced translators may have difficulty translating them
11. Use the simple past, present, and future
12. Be careful about using time and direction. Languages often related time to a direction, but they do not all use the same directions as English to indicate the movement of time
13. Avoid using the present as a metaphor for the past
14. Avoid nested statements, questions, and propositions
15. Put alternative concepts into separate clauses or sentences
16. Make logical relationships in sentences and paragraphs explicit
17. Make headings (e.g., "Overview") precise
18. Try to make the first clause in the paragraph present the paragraph's theme
19. Ensure that each paragraph builds, instead of growing weaker or confused
20. Delineate points that succeed each other: (first, second, third--or through other means)

Vocabulary Tips
---------------
1. Avoid slang 
2. Avoid jargon or overly technical language (not found in Scripture)
3. Use simple vocabulary when possible
4. Avoid compound/phrasal verbs
5. Use direct language that is straightforward and to the point
6. Try to avoid abstract language/nominalizing verb
7. Try to avoid semantically complex expressions. This includes technical theological terms whenever possible.
8. Use extra care when using loan words. These are words either borrowed by the NT from the LXX or borrowed by English from the NT Greek. This type of terminology will likely be unavoidable. Elaboration may be needed when dealing with loan words. Remember, these English words do not exactly correspond with the Greek concepts.
9. Avoid metaphors, metonyms, and synecdoches

Spelling/Procedural
-------------------
1. Do not capitalize divine personal pronouns or attributes
2. Do not use contractions 
3. Write in the third person
4. In general, write in the past tense when describing events that have already occurred
5. Be cautious about tense in prophecy as this will have implications about whether a prophecy has been or will be fulfilled
6. If possible, juxtapose two ideas right next to each other. The example above could be written as two paragraphs starting with “Some scholars” and “Other scholars” or as two sentences in the same paragraph
7. Avoid words with different possibly senses being used in a given paragraph. Also, make certain that a pronoun’s antecedent is clear and unmistakable
8. If possible, avoid words with multiple abstract senses

Editorial
---------
1. Ensure that the paragraphs are well formed before diving into the trans friendly challenges for each sentence
2. Figure out what the author wants to say, rather than just look at what he has written
3. Make headings (e.g., "Overview") precise
4. Watch out for unfortunate implications not intended by the author
5. Prefer shorter rather than longer sentences
6. Be ready to split a paragraph up into several paragraphs, if needed, for clarification
