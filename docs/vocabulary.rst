Vocabulary
==========

Since we are writing for a non-technical and non-native English reader we need to take great care in using technical terms.  In short, if you can use a non-technical word and communicate the same thing as a technical word, please do.  Only use technical jargon if it is required to communicate the point of the sentence.

The following lists are words that we suggest or disallow for use in order to help our resource communicate effectively.
