Markdown Notes
==============

If you want text to show up on separate lines then you need 2 line breaks between the lines.  For example:

``this will be on
the same line``

Shows up as

this will be on
the same line

But the following will show up on separate lines:

``this will be on``
``               ``
``separate lines``

Like this:

this will be on

separate lines
