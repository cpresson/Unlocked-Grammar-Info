Hebrew-specific Conventions
===========================

Terminology

Stems (Qal, etc.)

Forms:  Should we use grammar terms or form transliterations? Hebraists are increasingly using the latter, because the grammar terms are inaccurate, thus there is not agreement which terms should be used. They also may be difficult to translate. The form transliterations are meaningless, which is both a weakness and a strength, and need no translation.
