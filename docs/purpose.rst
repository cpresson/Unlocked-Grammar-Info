The purpose of this documentation is to present to the UGG, UHG, and UAG writers and editors the philosophy guiding the Unlocked Grammmar projects.

Finally, it will present the personnel with the needed information about online repositories and file locations, as well as instructions for working with them.

Purpose of the Unlocked Grammar projects
----------------------

The Unlocked Grammmar projects are meant to provide in Christian resource-deprived languages a set of biblical language grammar resources similar to the resources that Western Christian scholars use. The Unlocked Grammar resources are intended initially to serve as brief references for the native translator's rapid comprehension of the grammar in the original languages of the biblical text. Beyond this initial purpose, as the Unlocked Grammar resources are enhanced and expanded, they may be used as teaching grammars.

The UGG, UHG and UAG are meant to be freely translated and adapted into other languages.
