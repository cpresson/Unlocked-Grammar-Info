Purpose of the Unlocked Grammar projects
----------------------

The Unlocked Grammmar projects are meant to provide in Christian resource-deprived languages a set of biblical language grammar resources similar to the resources that Western Christian scholars use. The Unlocked Grammar resources are intended initially to serve as brief references for the native translator's rapid comprehension of the grammar in the original languages of the biblical text. Beyond this initial purpose, as the Unlocked Grammar resources are enhanced and expanded, they may be used as teaching grammars.

The grammars are intended to be translated and adapted into other languages, specifically the `Gateway Languages <http://ufw.io/gl>`_.
